# Prompt Engineering with LLMs

This repository contains a collection of Jupyter notebooks demonstrating various techniques and best practices for prompt engineering with Large Language Models (LLMs). The notebooks are designed to help you leverage LLMs for building powerful applications using API access.

## Overview

This collection covers key aspects of prompt engineering, including:

- **Understanding LLMs**: How they work and how to use them effectively.
- **Prompt Engineering Best Practices**: Core principles and tactics for crafting effective prompts.
- **Building Applications with LLMs**: Applying LLM APIs to various tasks like summarizing, inferring, transforming text, and expanding content.

## Notebooks

The following Jupyter notebooks are included in this repository:

1. **[Guidelines for Prompting](notebooks/l2-guidelines.ipynb)**
   - Explore key principles: writing clear and specific instructions, and giving the model time to “think”.

2. **[Iterative Prompt Development](notebooks/l3-iterative-prompt-development.ipynb)**
   - Analyze and refine prompts iteratively to generate optimized outputs, such as marketing copy.

3. **[Summarizing](notebooks/l4-summarizing.ipynb)**
   - Techniques for summarizing text with a focus on specific topics.

4. **[Inferring](notebooks/l5-inferring.ipynb)**
   - Methods to infer sentiment and extract topics from various texts, such as product reviews and news articles.

5. **[Transforming](notebooks/l6-transforming.ipynb)**
   - Use LLMs for text transformation tasks like language translation, spelling and grammar checking, tone adjustment, and format conversion.

6. **[Expanding](notebooks/l7-expanding.ipynb)**
   - Generate tailored content, such as customer service emails, based on specific inputs.

7. **[The Chat Format](notebooks/l8-chatbot.ipynb)**
   - Utilize the chat format for building chatbots capable of extended conversations and specialized tasks.
